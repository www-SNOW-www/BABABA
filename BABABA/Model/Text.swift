    "The majority of streetball games are played 3-on-3 on a half court. Special rules have been developed for half-court play:\nAt the beginning of the game and after each made basket, play begins at the top of the key. A 'checking' system is used to ensure that both teams are ready to begin play. This involves the offensive player saying 'check' while throwing the ball to his defender. The defender then makes sure their team is ready and then throws the ball back to begin play.\nIf the ball goes out of bounds during play, the ball can either be checked from out of bounds near where the ball went out or at the top of the key, depending on the rules established before the game.",
    
    "Features of one-on-one basketball which may differ from a normal game include make it take it, where making a shot is rewarded with possession of the ball instead of giving it to the opposing team. Also, when there is a change of possession, the player who just got the ball has to take the ball back behind the free throw line. Often times in one-on-one a player is expected to check the ball, meaning to start a possession by passing it to the opposing defender, who then passes it back.",
    
    "A team consists of five players on the court. A team must have a minimum of four players on the court to start a game.\nIf a team does not have at least four players by 10 minutes after the scheduled game starting time then that team will be charged with a forfeit.\nIn 3x3 basketball games, there are only 6 players on the floor, instead of 10 players during a 5x5 game. This means each player gets the ball in their hands more, and they get more meaningful opportunities with the ball."
